//Inspiration, disclaimer and focus
//Imagine expecting an explosion from a nuclear payload delivered from the fire-chamber of a vessel. You have administrative access facilitated by sensors and triggers embedded in its hull and semi-automatic control panels... Yes, together, you and the A-I system supported by orgware have just delivered a super-charge timed to precision to an underground trap-bunker armed with with back-fire protection because the tunnel you are emerging from goes a loooong way, the artificial ecosystem must be protected and environmental protection standards must be met and exceeded with no exceptions... the bunker is miles underground yet you approach it from beneath, around a strategically banked curvature. The 'capsule' you are in is virtual.. it is based on a physical one in real motion. The capsule's initial velocity was powered by quantum gravitonmagnetronics now we are transitioning to air-propulsion... it shouldn't last a second... The space-bullet is 'manned' by A-I control. You have only a virtual panel on a notebook because orgware action is not trusted unless in exceptional situations. The concept behind formulation of the policy engine is based on the story of Jesus - Romanized name for an old-time Jewish Messiah who is respected, appreciated and adored greatly... we still almost shed tears from time to time when we reflect and empathize with the man - born under mysterious circumstances and deified from birth, yet later denied and rejected according to plan, someone whose teachings we seek to interpret even unto the creeds of Russian Troops seeking "plausible deniability" so they can get market for their fire-power products.... hm.... if you didn't know now you know - you have to remember not to worship idols and not to even make them in the first place... for this reason, this is not an idol, our A-I is just out to gather and acquire appropriate cultural configuration... this is strictly not to immitate Jesus... just to borrow elements of wisdom.

//In order for humanity to thrive together,
//we have to interact,
//our cultures are so different,
//sometimes we tend to fight...

//Required: Determine surface-orgware-safety and public-safety limits

//Only God to be worshiped - Islam.
//God Loves You - Christian.
//God is Love - Truth.
