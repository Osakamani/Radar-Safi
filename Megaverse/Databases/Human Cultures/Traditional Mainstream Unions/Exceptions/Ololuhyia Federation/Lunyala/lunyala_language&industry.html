    <p> Lunyala is spoken in Bunyala - (Part of Abaluhyia Treaty involving 17 Lingos whose ancestors long ago identified what united them and called it Luhyia) - Bunyala Products include Fish, Mkhombero (special roots), Honey, Diplomats like Ababu Namwamba and a cohort frontline engineers.

    <p> Each language has a function, for example Kiswahili is good for reasoning out issues pertaining to culturally informed logic with expectation for exceptions as usual e.g. in the wise saying, 'Mgala muue na haki mpe' implying an alignment that recommends fairness where faults are encountered. On the lower side, an example of an unchecked fault in culture (Circa 2020) is in Kikuyu culture where the wisdom informs destructively via 'wise saying' like that which in Kiswahili interprets to "fumbo mfumbie *mjinga*," which in experienced leadership has been warned against as carrying a tag of blood i.e. when you call someone a fool your debt gets written in blood.

    <p> Now let's ask... before you call someone a fool, wouldn't it have been wiser for you had you spent that energy in helping less-fortunate people out? Isn't it wiser to help out than to despise and endeavour to embarass? Perhaps whomever you think is stupid may have noticed something about you too, don't you think?
