From 'umbeya' - gossip, so this basically becomes "The Gossipers". In Kikuyu and Kenya Urban Culture gossip is called 'mushene', usually practised among women while working or looking after children. In recent years though, the culture has had a spillover into groups of men - probably there is a correlation with men growing up in single-mother families and influence from gay behaviour.

Gossiping can be quite annoying because its nature is subjective. However, just like nuclear power it can be put to good use - might even be critical. Ancient order requires that 'mushene' and associated practices like eavesdropping remain a culture exclusively practised among women and girls. This is particularly so that issues are ironed out in bedrooms so that couples present a unified image and parents are able to formulate family rules so that families become practical entities.
