    <h2> THE YOUTH & RELIGION. </h2>
    <em> As presented by: </em> Baruch - <em>Youth Correspondent</em> </em>
    <p> As times are changing so is the behavioral change in most of the "gen-z" youth. First let us talk about the gender that is facing eradication or perhaps lets say distancing themselves from religion - "the males". This is the group that is best believed to conceal their problems due to the pride, lack of one to trust with such narrations, lack of support when necessary and fear of becoming a laughing-stock. The church might be considering itself warm-welcoming but might not be as warm-welcoming as it should be.
    <p> The youth need things that keep them in course but yet they should be interesting to them like; camps, hikes, societies and clubs. Some of the youth are facing internet related afflictions like watching pornography. It's been talked of in the near recent past from pulpits and wherever but the solution to that has not been found yet. For instance there is an addiction whereby to do away with it you need some counselling and guidance to find your way out. Social media is another thing though very informative most of the youths don't know how to go about it. Most of us the youth use it lucratively when bored or just need to see how peers are faring on. Sometimes it is a competition for lively fancies - i.e. <a href="">lured into questing for ecstasy</a> - that the bible refers to as vanity. Some are just facinated with the whole thing. It can be converted to better use if we get mentors who are going to advise us on such matters in relation to spiritual growth.
    <p> And at number two we have another contender - dangerous but glorified "fornication". Most youths don't just come to church for spiritual orientation but also make new friends who in the long run they ask out for a date. Its worrying because it is the lives of the same youth and teenagers that are at stake since nowadays diseases are rampant and their sexual behaviour is bound to be wanting in the long-run.
