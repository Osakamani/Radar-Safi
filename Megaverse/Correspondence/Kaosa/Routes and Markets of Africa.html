    <h2> <em>Introduction to Markets in Africa</em> </h2>
    <p> From Ting'a Market among the ridges of Gusiiland, the slopes lead streams down to two major water bodies. First there's lake Victoria to the South West then there's the Great Mediterranean Sea to the Far North at the end of The Great Nile. The water through streams flows every second; flows all-year round and originates in two places: springs and rainfall. Springs are exits from underground water buffers - which can store, process and continuously spew water for very long spells beyond rainy seasons. At the end of each year, tons upon tons of water and debri end up being dumped ever further downstream; always leaving deeper gulleys behind. Where does all this water come from? Can the water flows be used for good like in transportation of commodities to various markets? Can the damage be controlled?

    <h2> <em>Winds and Topography</em> </h2>
      <p> Clouds flow according to how winds and topography dictate. Ground-water on the other hand is ruled by topography and associated gravitational potential. However, when evaporation happens, temperature variations and windflow patterns dictate events.

    <h2> <em>Cloud Intel</em> </h2>
      <p> In Ting'a area as an example, when dark-clouds are up above the eastern horizon, most of the time it means that it is going to rain. Deciphering such intelligence requires <a href="">area familiarization</a>.

    <h2> <em>Market Intelligence</em> </h2>
      <p> Due to the huge diversities in topographies and climates all around Africa, <a href="">regional products</a> are as diverse as are cultures and subcultures. All these products and associated cultures are tabulated alongside member regions. Seasons are also monitored from strategically informed data inputs.
