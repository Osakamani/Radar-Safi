    <h2> <em>Highlighting the Need to Improvise</em> </h2>
    <p> Every now and then as humans we find that something is missing. For this reason some of us oft remain stuck in positions of lacking. We are not able to do because we do not have and we do not have because we have to do using what we do not have in order for us to get. It's a dead-lock... in the world of drunks in Kenya, it is just called 'lock' as used in, <em>"nitoe lock.."</em> - an informal request. Deadlock situations are common in all systems that require inputs. The power of improvisation as gifted unto humans comes in as a handy source of alternative solutions to deadlock problems.

    <h2> <em>Improvising for Failed Relationships</em> </h2>
      <p> Women flow like clouds responding to winds of change. Men on the other hand have to remain locked-on-mission or risk getting derailed. As humans, we are meant to stand against winds of change. It is the main reason why we got the brain and the muscle to help us move against wind and gravity. When women and children are in the picture, it becomes the God-given duty of men and elders to protect and fend for them on matters beyond their reach. However, the problem is rampant nowadays - many families are single-parented - especially single-mothered... in many instances you find there is only one parent and it is the mother. It is in such cases that <a href="">Teledaddy comes in handy</a>.

    <h2> <em>Defining Teledaddy (Relationship Intel)</em> </h2>
      <p> In Ting'a area as an example, when a couple is going through tough times it is usually about the way the couple interacts with the society forming its environment. Deciphering such intelligence requires <a href="">area familiarization</a>. Other than that is love and blessings.

    <h2> <em>Power to Improvise</em> </h2>
      <p> Blessedly as humans we are gifted with the power to improvise for whatever it is that we need whenever we cannot find the actual. Difficulties in improvising arise out of laziness, mental issues and overload. Deadlocks can also hinder improvision. Improvisation is indeed a major root of human creation.
