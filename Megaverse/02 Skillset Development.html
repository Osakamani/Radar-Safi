    <h2> Skillset Selection </h2>
    <a href="../Megaverse/Reception/join_as.html"> Recruitment Drive </a>
    <h2> Skillset Alignment </h2>

    <p> First of all we explore all the problems that are plaguing mankind these days, most of all we examine the extinction-level dangers, which communities find they have exposed themselves to because of adhering to false teachings. We delve into investigating how the things people do each day contributes to situations emanating from commitment to falsified ideals. We convert the information obtained into a database. Then we come up with a database of all skills available and respective valid motivation pointers.

  <h2> Declaration </h2> What is needed to be done is accurately targeted work by specialized teams. Our first step thus becomes identification of available skillsets.

  <h2> Tabulation of Available Skills </h2>
    <p> In the skillsets table, skills are tabulated alongside respective skill-levels in a field that automatically updates itself in response to progress, a field is provided for Artisan ID so that national artisanal and professional skill-data are suitably recorded for use by Radar Safi engine.

  <h2> Identification of Skill-Gaps </h2>
    <p> With the help of love we shall achieve this via targetted solutions. The goal is to channel available skills towards regeneration coupled with the generation of skills required for actual teamwork towards heaven, where heaven is for the living. Our deepest condolences to families of children deceived into believing that heaven is a place for the dead - got them seeking love in the wrong place. Love is required among the living, Heaven is for us to achieve.

    <p> When skill is not identified early and channeled properly, labour can be abused. The discussions in this chapter follows how to convert human capability to do work into profitability for everyone aligned to goodwill.

    <p> Particle interaction models are going to be utilized in development of skill-management models. The models are developed using Mathematical and Quantum Physics techniques to help societies form-up into suitable interconnected teams on various scales for collaborative action towards environmental protection and improvement.

    <p> Because people are gifted differently, and with good reason, the implication is that it would be wise if we can utilize the differences for goodwill. The Physics in this chapter is going to discuss logical approaches towards this end. Quantum Physics helps us utilize nomal distributions and helps us discover that we can supply provisions for the 1% - the particle outside the box; the inevitable exception in every block of code - the one that makes a distribution normal, that is, makes our systems capable of connecting seamlessly to real life.

    <h2> Selection and Recruitment </h2>

    <p> Selection requires criteria. Recruitment utilizes a form with provisions for registering and signing after agreeing to a proposal that must be drafted first within standards where love is upheld.

    <h3> Allowances </h3>

    <p> Field officers should never have to worry about where to get transportation to respective data collection posts.
