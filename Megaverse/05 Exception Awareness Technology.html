      <p> Below is an illustration to help interested parties understand how debris affect humanity and quality of life.

    <h2> Kababa the Keen Student </h2>
      <p> Kababa is a keen student. She goes to school everyday and to church on weekends because she wants to pass form-four and become a nun. At school, Kababa loves to learn - she particularly enjoys Mathematics. However, the Mathematics teacher is an immoral man, he teaches Kababa's class things that spell disaster for their morality. Colleagues fear and respect Mr. Ndege because he understands a subject that gives them horrors. He also heads the drama club which She enjoys so much. As a 'poaching' strategy the teacher feeds jargon to the girls in the hope that he would spoil them enough to have a wife from among them. Kababa loves this particular teacher because he is so good in Mathematics; he says, "Your mother times your father equals you!" Presumably in an effort to help them understand how one-times-one equals one. But he does not know! Eventually she starts dreaming of a life with him. He writes her a note with instructions that she destroys it after reading 'those dirty words'. Kababa's ambition begins to change; now she wants to become his wife but it is taking her a long time to abandon her dream of becoming a nun; she hesitates in letting the teacher have sex with her. A classmate notices the situation and tries to slice her off her new-found lover. She fights her, it becomes really bad. The police are called and they arrest Kababa because she had hurt her classmate so bad - they had to charge her with assault. Previously, the teacher had used to caress Kababa's breasts and it had made her feel really good... like she was in heaven... but he was changing her and she did not know.
      <p> As a couple, Kababa and the teacher had made plans. She had even registered for the national examinations in his name; being a special student it meant that she was going to do special exams - designed for disabled students. Initially she had spent all the school-fees she had been given by her uncle on him in an effort to please him. Later on, the lover had helped Kababa settle accounts and they had together agreed that they get married after she was through with exams. However, no sooner than she was done with exams than she was rudely shocked with the realities of life.
      <p> Being an intelligent creature of God, Kababa was able to discern that the teacher would only end up misusing her especially because he would always meet younger fresher girls at school when she was married and tied-up at his home with children all around. Her mind had been opened by drama verses he made for her to recite. He had written for her,
      <p align = "center"><em>You just flush it out!</em>
<p> in relation to aborting unborn children. If she had known, she wouldn't have let him use her but she was a minor and he was an apic abuser. Does she know this? Kababa's predicament is an illustration of how miseducation in some formal institutions of learning leads people to have documents professing skills yet actually they are worse-off than they could have just earned essential knowledge and acquired actual applicable skills. Isn't it better to be well than to be bureaucratically 'competitive'?

<h3> Airport </h3>

<p> Kababa fell again a second time and this guy really caressed her. He caressed her so much she passed out. Then he was scared and he rushed her to hospital. After that he was afraid of her. So when someone offered he fell in. Then the worst happened, she burst in on them and it was over. That was when she decided to become a house maid. She would work and work, and not think about anything, she would not look at anyone... she would just work. So she became a house-help.

<p> In her mind, she felt she could raise money for college. There was a slight problem though, she didn't have form-four documents because she couldn't use the certificate with the Mr. Ndege's surname. Not to mention he had retained her documents to compell her into going after him. She knew she had to become very smart.

<h3> Mahesh </h3>

<p> Arabic, probably deceptively abusive. He deceived her into thinking that his 'big-end' was called 'mkundu' so he would use her the way they usually do - what is it about arabs and anals? Tricking the virginity-rule? At around this time, all the nuns at the nearby convent are raped one night. No one is arrested, no one charged, our minds are just blown away.

<h3> Mofaya </h3>

Kababa's work led her to Mofaya. He was the son to a spiritual coughar. Culturally, it was forbidden for him to take her as his wife... but he did. After some time things became so bad for them it felt as though it would be better for her if he was dead and she was a rich widow. That was when things started going south. She acquired external advisors and his health started deteriorating. In Pacifica - the portion of the globe where they live, wars are fought spiritually in marriage and spouses are led to bury their lovers. It is not a game of guns and blood like in Atlantis. Yin and Yang however dictate that exceptions occur at the very centers of bulging masses. Pacifis has Atlantis at its core and Atlantis has Pacifis at its core.

      <p><em>Mitigation Measures</em>

      <h3> Exception Awareness Technology </h3>
      <p> In flaw-awareness technology teams of highly skilled experts including sociologists and geophysicists equipped with GPS capable systems and consoles work from remote posts e.g. along forks and ridges of terrains and in elementary/ junior and vocational training classrooms both of which make up <a href=""><em>critical-fronts</em></a> in respective dimensions. They are assisted by artificially intelligent remote sensing capability with <a href="">data-source intelligence</a>. The intel collaborates with teams in various locations. Teams rotate until a national fault-structure-formation map is constructed in two dimensions - the physical and the logical i.e. social spheres. Afterwards, mitigation measures are coordinated with the help of maps and graphs so obtained as well as data from debriefed teams after initial exploration. The data so obtained is fed into Radar Safi engines via suitably constructed forms and necessary remedies are initiated and mandated to informed executives for presentation to appropriate council meetings.
