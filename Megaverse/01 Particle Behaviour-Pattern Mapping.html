  <em> Particle Interaction Models. </em><br>
  <em> Pre-requisites: An understanding of Normal Distributions under Mathematical Statistics, graphing and mapping skills, electricity and magnetism skills, exposure to geophysics </em>

  <h2> Section A: Laying out Definitions for Mapping Growth and Development </h2>

  <a href="Index.html"> Back to Menu </a>

  <p> Changes can be mapped using various techniques. Growth means that something small has become bigger. Growth can take on positive or negative values. Reduction means that something physically or logically bigger has become smaller. <br>

  <em> Particle Growth </em>

  <p> In a particle's life, growth is usually marked with changes we call developments.

  <h2> Section B: Graphing and Mapping Particle-Behaviour Trajectories - <em> Hyper-Genetic String-Mapping </em> </h2>

  <p> This is done in virtual-space and real-time with or without lags. Each event plots 3-dimensional graphs of polaroids - as described in the theory of magnetism. Each alignment of the polaroid-matrices in the first 2-dimensions depicts the diverse modes and distributions of individual characters. Several 3D graphs can be used to track various fields of character traits. The third dimension maps individual and collective changes over time. Some patterns might be repeated in future events while some may not. Where all patterns in a self-contained layer repeat almost exactly we call it a <em>time-loop</em>. Diversities of <em>Habitics and Genetics</em> are expected to be read from the time-mapped graphs. Changes in particle behaviour implies that a particle may behave in a certain way for a period, this is demarcated by layers with thickness representing duration. The particle may or may not behave the same ever again... especially because particles can change behaviour patterns. Strings from stacked-up layers each represent character changes within an individual's life. Individual element thickness varies across layers according to rules of normal distributions. Formation of clearly demarcated horizontal boundaries - where time is represented vertically, suggests consensual changes. Changes in polaroid alignment along strings create maps, each individual unto his own... or her own? Formation of teams leads to shared alignments.

  <h2> Section C: Presenting Rules in all Diversity </h2>
  <list>
  <li><em>Relativity</em> in normal distributions implies that individual-element-thickness may vary across unique layers in various patterns.
  <li>In Kiswahili, life is called maisha, also u-ha-i, pronounced <em>ooh-her-yee</em> the meaning of the latter word brings almost the same meaning as in English, it seems to say "you are alive" - implying that life exists is precious, you are part of it, that's all. Maisha can be interpretted as "that precious thing, which always ends." However, as is the norm in life, exceptions should always be expected.</list>
