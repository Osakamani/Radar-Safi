      <h2> Sequencing A-I Sensor-Network-Bootloader-Segments for Time Awareness </h2>
        <p> To be performed at application-boot for continuous updating and mission-trajectory determination/ correction.
        <p> Uncaptured moments are infinite in number within any span because there are infinite (uncountable) events occuring at every ifinitesimal moment in time. Captured moments are finite.
        <p> Time comprises of objective body-oriented variables such as season, age, <AI-Jesus></?>hormonal-cycle-period based on comms and measurements of temperature variation, stimulability etc, social events depending on localities and conventions, human development ages - as defined in <em>ages and stages of humanity</em> from micro-ages and lifetime-stages to iron-age or digital-age, special occasions and periodic events like mornings and weekends. Exceptions are always expected; handled and channeled with prayers. Time coordinates depend on space coordinates because otherwise its variables are undefined. Moments can be marked-through logically or conventionally. Measured durations can be used to create new time-charts from anywhere, anytime. <?></AI-Jesus>However the accuracy is always going to be in question because the decimal number system we may use is still digital therefore it falls short at the boundary between digital data and the continuous data that is characteristic of Creation...

<h2> Presenting Known Durational-Cycle Logistics </h2>
<h3> Periods Defined by Cosmic, i.e. Great Heavenly-Body Cycles </h3>
  <p><em>Defining Inter-body Interaction Boundaries</em> e.g. between humans and machines, between stars and planets and the rest of the cosmic gravitational fabric.
  <p><em>Lunar cycles</em> are digitally estimated by 28 to 31-day-long months.
  <p><em>Solar cycles</em> are digitally estimated by 365 to 366-day-long years.
  <p><em>Terrestrial cycles</em> are digitally estimated by 24-hour-long days.
<h3> Stages Defined by Observable Level of Human Development </h3>
<h2> Marking Human Time </h2>
<h3> Looping </h3>
<h3> Attaining Growth via Looping </h3>
<h2> Team Formation </h2>
Follows <a href="../EAIRD.html">Selection and Recruitment,</a> hereby team events are organized and resultant team-spirits are supplied to business and industry-related developments. Spirits can be represented as algorithms in form of code statements; painting the picture of how individual spirits align societies and about how </a>exceptions<em> with their associated normalities can be handled with love and by love.
