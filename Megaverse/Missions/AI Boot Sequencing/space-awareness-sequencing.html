      <h2> Essential Variable Definitions</h2>
        <h3> Automatic Acceleration (A-sub-a) </h3>
          <p> Results from continuous pull (e.g. gravitational or magnetic acceleration at every infinitesimal moment) that grows or remains constant as it causes the distance e.g. between two bodies with masses A and B to shrink until the bodies collide into each other and become one body and so on. A measurable quantity to help observers determine the value of Aa is Velocity of one body e.g. B with the position of A being taken as relatively fixed. A-sub-a is defined as relative acceleration between any two bodies that is initiated by intrinsic properties / relative configurations of affected bodies. Where body A is gigantic in comparison to body B, B may not have the gravitational power to cause A to shift position but A will always affect the postion of B provided B is within range.

     <h2> Transition </h2>
        <p> In Creation, as we often find, things change and observers find that what was isn't anymore. Human environmental changes e.g. plant-growth usually happen in relatively slow rates in relation to average human detection capability. Detection however cannot happen seamlessly as if it were an analog process because cutting-edge instruments are digital and the time dimension upon which relative element positions are mapped is made up of continuous elements that cannot be counted... are they perhaps quantifiably discrete frames of moments defined durationwise by a constant like <em>Plank's Constant</em>? What is the highest frame-detection rate achievable?
        <p> Depending on the detection rates of observer's sensor-networks and on the rates of transition of unique moments, all moments can be captured or some moments can be missed. Some moments can also be captured to be processed at future times.
