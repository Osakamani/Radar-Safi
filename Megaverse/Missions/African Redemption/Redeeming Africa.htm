Africa has been weakened by subsequent invasions from various directions, angles and dimensions... However, in recent years, Africans have accumulated great pools of knowledge. The adversaries of Africa hide behind civillian populations of their own kind while they murder and persecute adults and children of African origin.

Mission Objective: 

Many children of African origin are drawn to man-made artifacts and equipment like bicycles, motor-bikes, vehicles, ornaments and fashionwear. These desires have led mothers to lock themselves up in ill-informed missions to catch as much money as they can before the day ends every day.

Targets: {Industry, Medicine, Family, 

In industry, all Tea Plantations must die except for few trees per household, neighbourhood or environmental conservation. Excessive labour on tea plantations must cease and in its place let us have accelerated effort towards production of food items we consume in hierarchichally corresponding quantities e.g. more maize for energy and beans for body building.

All medicine to be sourced from rooted organic sources i.e. straight from the farm with highly supported infrastructure.
