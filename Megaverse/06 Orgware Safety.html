    <p> Human life conditions itself according to what the adults let the children learn. In Radar Safi, the systems are open to stem curiosity-related exploits so we do not have to worry about the curious-type and radical hackers. Anyone that needs to understand how the system works and anyone that feels they can make a contribution shall find that teams are working to provide handles so that everyone's contribution is appreciated. Towards this end, a database of contributors is kept.

    <p> In eforcing safety and security, truth is told and maintained at all times so that children are not deceived about realities of life. This is done to ensure that generations are able to make informed decisions. As a contrary example, the common lie that is propagated in pseudo-Christian religions like Roman Catholicism, where social models thrive on telling children that their dead relatives have gone to be with the Lord and that the dead become saints like 'Holy Mary' and so on are strings of lies that have already claimed their toll in multiple places and times. <em>Shaka Holla</em> in Kenya (2023AD) is just one among many other related historical mass-suicide events. In such events the deceived have the notion that death is a doorway into heaven whereas in truth heaven is a situation we can co-create when we choose to live according to stipulations of Love. If you make people believe in lies you should expect drastic results. This is especially so because realities of life begin with what adults make children believe.

    <p> The roots of the culture that informs masses about pursuing heaven in death can be traced back to ancient Rome. Warriors in Rome and Athens would pursue a spiritual 'paradise' called <em>Valhalla</em>. They would fight bravely so they die and go to Hell, Hell was paradise for them, it informed their cultures and turned them into fiercesome warriors. However, the reality of Hell is more about creating situations where there is fire burning everywhere like in when the planet has been degraded so much and everywhere there is a volcanic disaster happening. In such an environment, chaos reigns and descendants of warriors, those whose <em>Habitics & Genetics</em> are aligned for war and associated savagery thrive and many people die until few are left to begin life again in a renewed planet. The situation though does not have to be like that over and over again, we can make a difference. We can make heaven a reality using handles that have been created for us. In Radar Safi, such handles are explored, exploited and applied to facilitate Orgware Safety, Sustainability and System Security.
