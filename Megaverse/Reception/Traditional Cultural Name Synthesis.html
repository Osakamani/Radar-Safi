      <p> Involves a <a href="">formal-inquiry system</a> where peers supply traditional cultural information unto one another for the sake of finding grounds of interaction within the context of Love. Those who claim to have no traditional cultural affiliation - (<em>"wakosa kabila"</em>) - can use their Christian, English, French, Purtuguese, Muslim, Hindu or other names depending on influence because the system will eventually grow to include all global cultures. Of importance are statements describing the cultural origins of names to facilitate tallying of associated contexts.
