    <h2> Traditional-Cultural-Name Synthesis (TCNS) System [Design-Mode] </h2>

      <p> Involves a <a href="">form-inquiry system</a> where members of the orgware community supply traditional cultural names alongside respective cultures within the context of Africa. Those who claim to have no traditional cultural affiliation can use Christian, English, French, Purtuguese, Muslim or Hindu names depending on influence because the system will eventually grow to include all global cultures.
