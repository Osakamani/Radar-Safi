    <h2 align="center"> Notes on Debris Disposal </h2>

    <p align="center"> In Physical terminology, <br>
You are a particle, I am a particle, <br>
We are raster particles with diverse behaviours, <br>
as seen from above, or from afar, <br>
as we interact with one another, <br>
as we affect eachother, <br>
as we together also affect others <br>
and as they affect us back, <br>
like so... and so on...

    <p align="center"> As particles, sometimes we attach ourselves <br>
to other particles, <br>
sometimes we consume them, <br>
sometimes we produce other particles, <br>
sometimes we treasure the so produced particles, <br>
sometimes we dump them away from ease of access, <br>
sometimes we cause other particles to stop functioning, <br>
sometimes we revive those that had stopped... <br>
so... do we have rules of interaction?

    <h2> Classification of Debris </h2>

        <h4> Rock, Soil and Gravel debris </h4>
        <h4> Plant debris </h4>
        <h4> Animal debris </h4>
        <h4> Ex-Factory debris </h4>

      <h3> Erosional Debris </h3>
      <p> Persistent water-flows along specific channels causes rocks, soil, and other particles to be plucked off persistently from newly exposed top layers and ferried-off downstream. Where the water-flow is significantly shallow, debris in the form of small soil and rock particles gets deposited along the water's path i.e. where gradients allow for significant damming. The water dumps the soil in dune-like mounds. If the water is seasonal or rain-fed, when the flow dries up significantly such dunes can be spotted and utilized. This soil that is so dumped is called silt. It is usually very fine and is good for construction and agriculture.

  <h1> DYNAMIC PARTICLE INTERACTION MODELS FOR APPROPRIATE debris DISPOSAL TOWARDS MITIGATION OF MENANCINGLY UNCHECKED GLOBAL CRUSTAL FAULT FORMATION </h1>

  <h1> Executive Summary </h1>

    <p> As is the design in Creation, particles can attract or repel one another depending on the forces in-between or around them and depending upon respective inertias (described as relative trajectory multiplied by relative momentum). After initial approaches, particles can collide and fuse into each other or bounce-off or disintegrate, particles can consume particles, particles can grow and multiply. Particles can be consumed or have life snuffed out of them. Active particle annihilation is forbidden save for consumption and protection purposes within strict rules because the practice is wasteful. Humanity can be described as particles depicting interaction patterns in models that can be studied and understood, expounded on, developed and engineered scientifically for good.

    <p> Human works and soil erosion (both natural and artificial), have resulted in infamous wonders that could spell doom for humanity if unchecked and mitigated in a timely manner. As a solution, this booklet discusses a cutting-edge scientific approach towards mitigation via environmentally safe by-product disposal among other methods. It additionally delves into how available manpower within affected localities can be utilized in a friendly way to achieve persistent states of beneficially active industry.

    <p> Key phrases: volcanicity-review, soil erosion and fault formation, beneficial industry, environmental degradation mitigation and control

    <h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> Human beings exist among Creation as a force of teams and teams of teams created purposely to work together and to do it in geographically and intergenerationally dynamically shifting patterns. Work is supposed to be done towards collective and individual improvement and towards mitigation and control of environmental degradation. The result of works towards this end can be compared to inverting theories that describe humanity as the resultant of a survival-of-the-fittest contest (theories in this work partly oust, and partly fill-in on the theory put forward by Charles Darwin and other contenders - the common theory of evolution - a theory that has failed because it ends up having mysteriously missing links as it attempts to claim spontaneity of Creation, that is, independence from A Supreme non-human Mega-Gigantic Being, Who lives within and all around various dimensions of power that are always within us, all around us and everywhere else - A Mighty Intelligence that can be understood and teamed up with towards recruitment and reinforcement for accomplishment of our special mission as humanity.

    <h2> Chapter One </h2>

      <em> Here for a Purpose; </em>

      <h3> Presentation of The Problem in Context of Solution </h3>

        <p> Our planet's crust has always been mined by people and carved persistently for building material or minerals, or for various other works. It has also always been eroded by water provided the water presence remains at regions of higher altitudes and provided that there are spaces at lower altitudes that the precious liquid can occupy. Sometimes we dig out rocks to expose underlying layers of coal or for other reasons. Sometimes were are building roads, sometimes we are building houses with corrugated roofs without realizing that runoff water digs into the ground extremely deeply over time. At other times, while carving cuboid or other blocks for construction or after washing soil to extract gold particles, we leave debris behind and so on. This chapter presents suitable methods of reaping from debris to claim fringe results that are environmentally friendly and yield exponentially. The chapter goes on further into exploring how utilization and management of the gigantic cavities left on earth's crust by mining-related or erosional related extraction-led faulting events can be averted to facilitate reversal and control of degradation of crustal integrity. This chapter presents a deliberate egineering methodology and suggests additional research, exploration and development towards aversion of natural and man-made calamities.
