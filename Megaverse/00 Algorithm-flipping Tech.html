      <p> One of the most outstanding mistakes in modern democratic systems is foreign imposition. In this error, we have ruling parties because of numbers and the philosophy of majority imposing their way on others. This does not have to be the case. People need not be counted. <em>Sensitive Systems</em> can learn to channel normal events and exceptions properly depending on need and best practices towards maximization of goodwill. AFTS has been designed towards solving cultural discrimination problems arising out of systemically abused cultural diversity.

      <h3> Mode Selection </h3>

        <p> In this technology, sets of algorithms are listed across a procedure. Then the artificial intelligence chooses a logical trajectory by matching requirements to respective outputs from the floated algorithms like in an automatic dial. Information is released on need-to basis in short bursts with prioritization of listening capability. The dial is built from GPS data-powered functions aligning rules to pre-stated requirements by deciding and selecting a cultural algorithm to use. The AI remains aware of the user's limits, preferences and capabilities. The mode so selected can be changed again when situation calls for it. For example when a unit moves from a Christian region to an Islamic region the mode of interaction changes... e.g. the greetings with <em>exception sensitivity capability (ESC)... in Industry the wheel rolls until a workforce with suitably matched skills and logistics is selected and slotted for recruitment</em>.

        <h4> Machine Learning Opportunity; Dynamic Demographer Subsystem </h4>

          <p> Where more than one mode of operation is applicable e.g. when selecting appropriate culture to base advisory on in metropolitan areas where cultural hybridization is maximized. In such cases, <a href="07 About Radar Safi - Smart App.html">Radar Safi</a> engine presides over a democratic function-selection algorithm for maximization of targetted benefits like choosing appropriate words so that resultantly the culture is engineered effectively to serve stipulations as updated in <a href="../Megaverse/Missions/Index.html"><em>pending-missions</em></a>. Mode selection implies that our AI changes character according to needs, rules and available opportunities. Rules can be broken based on formulae to be arrived at via teamwork in jkuatcorp.slack.com

      <h3> Mission Selection </h3>

        <p> Major missions are fed into and read from <a href="07 About Radar Safi - Smart App.html">Radar Safi</a> databases dynamically. Data inputs are generated from a pre-designed hash-tag-based web-activity-rooting system. The probing engine runs on policies formulated by AI-Jesus - an artificial intelligence platform designed for Mount Moses Observatory as documented in https://mountmosesobservatory.wordpress.com/AI-Jesus. Daily and seasonal trends of hash-tags in social media channels are tallied alongside critical requirements towards establishment of a global kingdom on earth where love reigns. Strategic steering committees comprising of spiritual leaders and cultural experts arrives at consensus on best moves from which they give structurally guided recommendations that the AI uses together with skillset availability data, non-human resource data and progress logs to determine and prioritize critical missions for individuals and collectives. Recommendations are also based on regions, respective cultural orientations and resulting needs. At an advanced stage, respective mission selection functions are arrived at from automatically generated code from triggered initiatives that are prioritized and updated in respective databases so that outputs are available as alternatives to feed into the algorithm-flipping technology subsystem.
