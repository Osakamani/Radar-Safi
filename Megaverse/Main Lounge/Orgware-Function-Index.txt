>Student Programmer<

<! Studies programming and comes up with all sorts of interesting ideas. For example, as appears is the case today 7/7/2023 AD in global geopolitics, the world was stuck in a lock of tricks. The locks came to light so that we may unlock and free the children. Now we can make improvements. All Africans can migrate from the whole of Arabia into Tunisia - to concentrate forces, then the whole of Africa can defend and support. Or we can let Arabs and Indians play out their game of courage. Arabs are becoming treacherous because of big brother Russia who is fighting his own kind of retrogressive 'World War 3' and nothing is as appealing to these crazies as prospects of joining him in war; whereas in islamic activism, tendency to war is escalated by aspiration to become a Shahid.

<! The task of the programmer in this mission is to ask pointed questions meant to influence child communities into having a deep interest in studying and refining our ever developing software front. The reasoning in setting focus on children is that if all children are saved globally persistently and transitioned across generations within the essential-calculable-loops of time, the whole world can be guided into heaven. Towards this end shall the programmer's work be done to achieve the goals of the Spirit of The Great Creator that Resides in it and From Whom all was made to exist and made to be witnessed of and worked for from within ranks.
