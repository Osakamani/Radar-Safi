2023 AD - World in Trouble

So much pain and violence,
School of death overperforming...
From instruments to spells,
Weaving stories of fire and bloodshed...
Machettes with coatings of fresh human blood,
Gunshots with real casualties,
Hit and run incidences with old providers left bleeding-out,
Illicit staff running rescue stations,
Others yearning to harvest organs.

Tears are shed here while nextdoor it is a fresh wedding,
While others are mourning others feel like ululating,
Truly confusion reigns, one family now torn in the middle,
How can they be together when each is professing from
a different creed?
