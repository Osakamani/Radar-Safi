    <h2> Policy Engine: </h2>
    <h3> Policy Engine for Alignment towards Disaster prevention </h3>
    <h3> Policy Engine for Alignment towards User support </h3>

    <h2> Summary: </h2>
    <p> Radar Safi is an application engine through which systems, consumers and providers can gain access to essential real-world information. The framework makes use of dynamic databases, APIs, artificial intelligence, computer networks, smart-phones and sensor systems to acquire and disseminate critical knowledge to users. Development requirements include the following:

    <h3> Part 1: System Requirements </h3>
    <list>
    <li> A database of contributors (data collection and entry agents) supported with automated quantification of individual and collective contributions as factors towards remuneration via success of projects in disaster prevention, food security, individual wellness, service provision and real-estate with software development to support nutrition and general wellness of clients.
    <li> Database of craftsmen and artisans, professionals and relevant policy development officers available in localities with respective skillset update capability and brief resume service
    <li> Database of accessible springs, resources, communities living there and respective mineral contents of water
    <li> Databases of essential service providers including domestic products and services
    <li> GPS mapping capability
    <li> A database of missions that updates itself according to need vs available capabilities
    <li> Application Programming Interface (API) Template Designs and User-Friendly interfaces
    <li><a href="">Active geological fault progression tracking system with active data processing and messaging subsystem</a>
    <li> Recommendation presenter and selected solution support
    <li> Active recruitter with suitable display and interaction consoles
    <li> User-age, skillset and situation-based need-determination-system
    <li> Mission reconciler/ valid strategic-approach tallying and qualification system</list>

    <h2> Policy Formulation Criteria </h2>
    </list>
    <li> The Global Public Service Policy that shall run Radar Safi engine must at all times be forged from pillars of outstanding heaven-oriented human cultural and religious wisdom.
    <li> Availing dynamic real-life globally positioning (GPS) data to users implies that data-collectors must be recruitted and equipped sufficiently to supply valid form-data as shall be required from time to time
    <li> The system to utilize consensus in data collection to ensure world-class accuracy
    <li> Suppliers of required information to win prizes craftily engineered to lure, recruit and sustain motivated manpower
    <li> System to support development and maintenance of sustainable geophysical habitats and new niches for mankind and other beneficial life-forms. (Clearly mosquitoes are going to have a hard time securing a spot.)</list>

    <h2> Database Design </h2>

    <p> Our databases begins with forms, which facilitate structured data collection. Forms are made up of fields with harmonized blanks that must be logically designed so that they remain relevant in their respective areas of application.

    <p> First of all we begin with contracts. Our first table comprises of contributors including a board of governors that formulates and reviews policies, contributions and shared properties because people are attached to wealth. <em> "Aase enibo yao ere nao enkoro yao ekare." ~ Ekegusii. </em>

    <h2> Form Design </h2>

    <p> Radar Safi requires to know where prospective members live and where they can move around safely. This means that the forms must have provisions for current home address and previous home, school and work addresses as well as a coding system of regions to be checked off according to how a prospecting recruit is willing to move around collecting geographical and social data. Coordinates include time-coordinates e.g. school-time is time spent learning to stay outside at night or perhaps night-driving when an individual's life has been built in daylight and so on.

    <h1> Part 2: Funding </h1>

    <p> Given that Radar Safi is going to be a very useful application for many people and it is going to add value to Android phones, it is expected that Google will sponsor the project. Other organizations involved in environmental protection activities like World Bank, Microsoft, other NGOs and government agencies are also expected as sponsors.

    <h1> Part 3: System Specifications </h1>

    <p> Being an engine, Radar Safi is going to run on a data-synchronization-based subsystem that actively employs orgware in data validation. It is to be linked to an AI subsystem. Depending on a user's respective GPS, the system is going to avail data based on individual and collective needs depending on dynamic information and formulae that actively feeds into info from respective databases from respective sources. Normalized databases can be hosted on distributed centralized banks that are guarded by Exception Awareness (EA technology), - updated by consensus and other verification methodologies. Teams to ensure that agents are well motivated so that the banks are continuously updated like in a financial block-chain system. From the data obtained, the team shall develop algorithms for geophysical computations and supply information to mandated mitigation authorities e.g. The Ministry of Environment in Kenya.
    <p> The Artificial Intelligence (AI) sub-engine of Radar-Safi to be powered by AI-Jesus - currently under development for <a href = "https://github.com/Mount-Moses-Observatory"> Mount Moses Observatory </a>.

    <h1> Part 4: User Experience </h1>

    <p> Apart from provisioning subscribed applications with location-aware data-sets via API, Radar Safi shall have a client application. The app shall utilize intrinsic AI capabilities to provision the user with alerts to help guide on where to go, what to do and what to say within the limits of love. The system shall also help the user to understand what not to do depending on where they are. For example not to wear scanty clothing in regions where rights can be violated by communities or other crowds on the ground.

    <h1> Part 5: Team Challenges and Recommendations </h1>

    <p> Acquiring a team that is dedicated on the development of this project and connecting with sponsors are some of the major challenges currently. A team of three will suffice for the Alpha version to be availed within six months - someone with reliable connections and sponsors, one with system development skills and one with skills in public relations. Coding and database skills, driving skills, riding skills and knowledge of Geography, Geophysics, Mechanics including Quantum Mechanics and Geographical Information Systems (G-I-S) can be a basic requirement for all team members. Finance skills and knowledge of local cultures to imply added advantage.

    <h1> Part 6: Proposals </h1>
    <h3> To JKUAT </h3>
    <p> Apart from Technical Support, various proposals shall be designed and sent to sponsoring organizations because the application spans many industries from education support for cohesive cultural and industrial development all the way to mineral research. Data collection involves physically accessing all the regions that are inhabited by humans within the continent of Africa. Artisans in their respective field diversities are going to have their resumes made for them from narration and published on suitable sites. It is necessary to take note that disaster prevention includes preventing environmental degradation - a problem, which when unchecked within available time-slots leads to faulting as has been illustrated. Furthermore, untamed faulting can be shown to be leading to volcanic eruptions and other disasters - problems that should never come anywhere near humanity when our work is done well. If we can arrive at an arrangement, students can work as data agents and virtual coding interns. It helps that students come from everywhere and can be accessed, supported and coordinated structurally from central locations i.e. colleges and other educational and character development institutions even as they gain critical skills in life.

    <h3> To current and prospective sponsors </h3>

    <p> The team at Radar Safi much appreciates your support. We hereby warmly extend this invitation to active development of a new kind of rooted intelligence dubbed <a href="">data-source intelligence (DSI)</a>. It abstractly involves acquiring data dynamically as in a feedback processing and tuning system to help engines and users stay abreast with critical changes in environments and communities so that data values are allowed to facilitate the generation of targetted recommendations through inbuilt algorithmically aware exception handlers (AAEH processors) as well as accepted normal event processors. <em> "Yaani ing'a gento gete i'ngento gete" </em>

  <h2> Chapter Four </h2>

    <em> Real-Estate, Research and Development (R&D) </em>

    <p> Before you build a house for people to live in, it is imperative that you figure out what they are going to be eating while living there. It is also wise to figure out what they are going to be doing as their contributions to the rest of goodwill. To build the house you will need timber and blocks, bricks or other materials like corrugated iron sheets or grass for thatching. You will also need to know the people who are going to do the actual construction for you, what they will eat while working and how their wages will be paid.
    <p> If the house is a commercial building, rent from the building may take a while and is not available at the onset of the construction project.
