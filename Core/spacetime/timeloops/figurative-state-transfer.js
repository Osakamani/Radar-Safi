//Hypothesis
//Given a time-period, t, what is uttered "in-the-now figuratively" ends up being experienced real-life within a quantized time-loop.

//Analysis
//Given the hypothesis, it can be construed that if your language is constructed figuratively around destruction you will only reap destruction, whereas if you language is constructed figuratively around everlasting life you will surely achieve it upon the exhaustion of the lapse of time that meets requirements of quantum time for the specified purpose upon which the language was constructed in the first place.
