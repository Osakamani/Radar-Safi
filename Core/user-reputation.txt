Honesty is a virtue that is not common wholesale to the whole of humanity in all respective alignments resulting from individual and collective struggles or endeavours. Whenever a user acts fairly a good node is created. These nodes accumulate into creating reputation ratings that other users can rely on. It is all probabilistic of course and exceptions can occur. Exceptions must therefore always be expected catered for in advance, systemically.

Where user reputation rating rank significantly, the user may for example enter into a public transportation portal and get assistance to wherever they need to be without any unnecessary delays or other inconveniences.
