    <h3> REF: CREATION OF INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN EARTH AND SPACE EXPLORATION MISSION </h3>
      <h4> Justification </h4>
        <p> We write to invite you to partnership in business and development. Our motto is to study and Quantify Diversities in Earth's global Structural Integrities </em> both physical and logical. The goal is to bring together our respective powers for channeling towards environmental protection.
        <p> <em> Our current Mission is to map Cultural Geotopographies, Geosovereignties and Unions as Expressed in Natural Geodiversities of Humans and Respective Habitats </em>
        <p> <em> Current Stage: </em> Development of Exception Handling Techniques.
        <p> We are working on an application engine called <a href="../../Index.html">Radar-Safi</a>, the system is meant to run on android and other devices. It shall work by giving intelligent insights to users by actively collecting data and information from environment and networks.
        <p> Due to the critical nature of the program, it's policy engine is based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. It is expected to work and provide solutions to human problems and to have the power to keep working despite challenges. Part of the exception handling is public involvement in development. We seek to design a culturally aware system to help reintegrate Africa for culturally-powered interactions that yield teamwork in industry and trade towards self-sustenance and growth. Due to the scope of the project, the exception handling engine must be designed such that it expects errors and diverts respective driving spirits via media outlets by distracting and circumventing while submitting logs to server or other techniques, so as to allow development teams to build friendly solutions or workarounds within available time-slots. The exceptions are not always necessarily errors. They are to be handled before-hand as exceptions; not necessarily bad. They are to be contained, isolated and developed for constructive use or as pivots for self-correction. Meanwhile the main program flow is allowed to continue in alternative threads as elected from among possibilities. With lots of love and forgiveness we shall overcome injuries sustained because sometimes we love when we should avoid.
        <p> The goal as far presentation is concerned it would be in Radar Safi's best interests to create online simulations. Whereas most of the simulations are currently in text and mathematical logic, it can be expected that future models are going to include real connections with real physical and spiritual manifestations as the data comes in and as we work together towards achievement of the <em>ideal state</em> of global civilization promised by Jesus.
